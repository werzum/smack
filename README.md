# Smack! A React Workout App

Smack allows to generate a rudimentary Sandbag Workout Session.
You can select different moves (eg. hook, left jab, heel kick), the number of moves and the time between them. Then, a random sequence of the selected moves is generated and played via audio, instructing you for a n-move workout. Works best with a Sandbag, but can also be done by Shadowboxing - whatever keeps you fit.
It is based on a funky application of Howler and SetTimeOut, generating a queue of random Sounds/Commands as defined by the user.
Simply run "npm install" to install dependiences.
